The different patterns and principles used in GRASP are controller, creator, indirection, information expert, low coupling, high cohesion, polymorphism, protected variations, and pure fabrication. All these patterns solve some software problems common to many software development projects. These techniques have not been invented to create new ways of working, but to better document and standardize old, tried-and-tested programming principles in object-oriented design.  Larman states that "the critical design tool for software development is a mind well educated in design principles. It is not UML or any other technology.":{$\mkern1mu$}272{$\mkern1mu$} Thus, the GRASP principles are really a mental toolset, a learning aid to help in the design of object-oriented software.},

The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin, first introduced in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns discussing software rot.:{$\mkern1mu$}2\textendash 3{$\mkern1mu$}The SOLID ideas are The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility. The Open\textendash closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification." The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract. The Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use." The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretes."The SOLID acronym was introduced later, around 2004, by Michael Feathers.Although the SOLID principles apply to any object-oriented design, they can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development.},
